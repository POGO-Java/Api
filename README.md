This api implementation is based on Grover-C13 one (https://github.com/Grover-c13/PokeGOAPI-Java).

What we did on this implementation is to strip out blocking and sync calls in favor of callbacks and interfaces plus lombok getter and setter got removed. The sample activity included in the pack should give you a better taste of this.

This api impl has been reworked by Rama and iGio90 and is using contributions from the pogo-java team.
